    </header><p>Hello, again.</p>
<p>I finished third chapter of <a href="https://freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a>&rsquo;s web design course. It was solely about colours and honestly was a bit boring but an easy achievement, anyway.</p>
<p>And yes, I changed my <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> theme <a href="https://github.com/joeroe/risotto">risotto</a> to <a href="https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch">etch</a>. This one is more minimal and easy-to-read, at least for me and my eyes. Besides technically less moving parts; no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, no <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Web_fonts">web fonts</a> and icons, etc. I lost personal information area which was in right panel but not a problem, I added a contact page specially for these information.</p>
<p>Weekend was good, I rested and slept more than plenty. Cleaned and re-organanized my room. I made a big box of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste">e-waste</a>; three old and unfunctional mobile computers, too many ram modules from different dimensions and eras, tangled cable colonies, old speakers and headphones, a cocktail of a dozen harddrives, cd and dvd drives, a wireless mouse, more cables, etc. All hoard will go to an <a href="">NGO</a> for recycling and they&rsquo;ll use the income for education.</p>
<p>Again last weekend, played <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft</a> for the first time ever. Of course I heard it and watched some crazy videos. But until <a href="https://play.google.com/">Google Play</a> gifted it&rsquo;s mobile version with my new <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/">Chromebook</a> never tried before. It is a good sandbox game but maybe too grindy for me (yes, a guy shoved thousands of hours to online games wrote this sentence).</p>
<p>Lastly, I poked <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> a little. It&rsquo;s complicated if I understand right. I just read a few page from <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git Book</a> but maybe I should look for easier entryways. Still, I managed to</p>
