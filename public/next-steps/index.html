    </header><p>Hello again, dears.</p>
<p>Last week, I finished <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> Responsive Web Design course&rsquo;s first section and built a simple survey as a certification project. No <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a> code demanded, so I didn&rsquo;t bother with it, just completed the form in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a> and earned my first certificate.</p>
<p>Honestly, because of curriculum I was hoping a little more complicated certificate project. I can understand there&rsquo;s not much quirky things with plain HTML, some basic understanding about tags and attributes solves the most of entry-level problems but maybe they can demand a little more challenging things, especially some CSS knowledge would be nice (the only thing they demands linking a css file to html file) and lessons already contains nice amount of information about basic CSS.</p>
<p>Next sections, as far as I understand, more CSS oriented. Starts with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model">box model</a> and more about with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox">Flexbox</a> and typography. Maybe this is why first section ends with an HTML only project.</p>
<p>I am aware, I am a little bit more slow nowadays. Frankly, this isn&rsquo;t about the course or curriculum but about my daily life. I was more lazy and found interesting excuses for not working on my learning the programming journey, unsurprisingly. But this is not means everything is bleak, also I made some reasonable things too. For example, found out <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> and decided to use it together with FreeCodeCamp. Worked a little bit more on <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>, at least now I can handle this blog&rsquo;s simple tasks from command-line.</p>
<p>Weekend was uneventful, I watched second season of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1869454/">Good Omens</a>. Ordered a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy">light therapy</a> lamp (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_box">lightbox</a>?).</p>
<p>After sending this post, I&rsquo;ll start reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)">Dune</a>, which I was delaying for years. Wish me luck!</p>
<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
