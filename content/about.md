I am an amateur, an autodidact. Trying to learn computing and programming from online resources. I started this blog as an online home for me.

I will try to share my learning experience and notes in the upcoming days.

Built this website with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and using [etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch) theme, writing posts as [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and hosting it on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

My computer is just another cheap Chromebook and works OK for now.

Thank you for visiting.
