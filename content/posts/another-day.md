Hello, again.

I finished third chapter of [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/)'s web design course. It was solely about colours and honestly was a bit boring but an easy achievement, anyway.

And yes, I changed my [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme [risotto](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto) to [etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch). This one is more minimal and easy-to-read, at least for me and my eyes. Besides technically less moving parts; no [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), no [web fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Web_fonts) and icons, etc. I lost personal information area which was in right panel but not a problem, I added a contact page specially for these information.

Weekend was good, I rested and slept more than plenty. Cleaned and re-organanized my room. I made a big box of [e-waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste); three old and unfunctional mobile computers, too many ram modules from different dimensions and eras, tangled cable colonies, old speakers and headphones, a cocktail of a dozen harddrives, cd and dvd drives, a wireless mouse, more cables, etc. All hoard will go to an [NGO]() for recycling and they'll use the income for education.

Again last weekend, played [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) for the first time ever. Of course I heard it and watched some crazy videos. But until [Google Play](https://play.google.com/) gifted it's mobile version with my new [Chromebook](https://www.google.com/chromebook/) never tried before. It is a good sandbox game but maybe too grindy for me (yes, a guy shoved thousands of hours to online games wrote this sentence).

Lastly, I poked [git](https://git-scm.com/) a little. It's complicated if I understand right. I just read a few page from [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) but maybe I should look for easier entryways.

Thank you for reading!
