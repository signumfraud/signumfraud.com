Hello people!

I was checking my [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) account and saw an interesting detail in my analytics. Somehow, this blog viewed by at least 1000 different people in few weeks. It's interesting for a bunch of reasons, one example; I didn't promote this blog anywhere except my [github](https://github.com) bio and [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/) bio, and this isn't promotion really. Because I don't have any followers and/or significant content on both accounts.

Another one, finding here when searching for a public figure not really possible; I choose the name *Signum Fraud* for obvious reasons but crossing the *did you mean* bridge is hard. So, I think these visitors from not outerspace maybe but not all of them real people.

Whatever, real or some kind of bot, getting a thousand visitors feels good. Maybe I should aim for 10000 even for 100000 as next station.

Thank you for reading, like always!
