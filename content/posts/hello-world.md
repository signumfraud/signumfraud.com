As an aspiring programmer, I couldn't think of more cliche expression other than "hello world" for a title of first post.

I am not a CS student, neither an engineer nor working on tech related job. Somehow I got the idea that computing and programming were fun things. So, I made some research and nowadays trying to learn basics.

I just finished first section of [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/)'s Responsive Web Design course. I think I know a few things about HTML now and I'll start next section after completed my drudgery with this website.

I hope my English is a little better than my programming skills.

Thank you for reading!
