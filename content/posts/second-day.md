Today I finished second section of [FreeCodeCamp]()'s Responsive Web Design course and the task was building a cafe menu. I learnt about `<style>` tag, referring `.css` files from `.html`, comments, selectors (id, class, etc.), font properties and text formatting, margins and padding and something more I didn't remember at the moment. I think this is a productive day, I hope I can keep this tempo in the upcoming days.

Also today I learned about [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) a bit, obviously because of [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and updated my first post and about page, added links.

That's all folks, thank you for reading!
