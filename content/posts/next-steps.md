Hello again, dears.

Last week, I finished [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Responsive Web Design course's first section and built a simple survey as a certification project. No [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) code demanded, so I didn't bother with it, just completed the form in [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and earned my first certificate.

Honestly, because of curriculum I was hoping a little more complicated certificate project. I can understand there's not much quirky things with plain HTML, some basic understanding about tags and attributes solves the most of entry-level problems but maybe they can demand a little more challenging things, especially some CSS knowledge would be nice (the only thing they demands linking a css file to html file) and lessons already contains nice amount of information about basic CSS.

Next sections, as far as I understand, more CSS oriented. Starts with [box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model) and more about with [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) and typography. Maybe this is why first section ends with an HTML only project.

I am aware, I am a little bit more slow nowadays. Frankly, this isn't about the course or curriculum but about my daily life. I was more lazy and found interesting excuses for not working on my learning the programming journey, unsurprisingly. But this is not means everything is bleak, also I made some reasonable things too. For example, found out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and decided to use it together with FreeCodeCamp. Worked a little bit more on [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [github](https://github.com/), at least now I can handle this blog's simple tasks from command-line.

Weekend was uneventful, I watched second season of [Good Omens](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1869454/). Ordered a [light therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy) lamp (or [lightbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_box)?).

After sending this post, I'll start reading [Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)), which I was delaying for years. Wish me luck!

Thank you for reading!
